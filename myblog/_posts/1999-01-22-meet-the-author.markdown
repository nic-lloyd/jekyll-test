Nice to meet you! I am Nicolas Lloyd, an aspiring web developer fresh out of college!

I attended college at Rowan University in Glassboro, New jersey; a small college town about 30 minutes east of Philadelphia.
Prior to moving to New Jersey for school, I was born and raised in the suburbs of Houston, Texas. I have played soccer since
I was six years old.

I was drawn toward computer science when I took a C++ course as a mechanical engineering major my freshman year. What piqued
my interest the most was the low barrier for entry involved with coding. At any level of understanding you are able to complete
many projects that you can be proud of. Whether it's your first `hello world` program for a new language, or a full stack 
progressive webapp, there is always something for a programmer to work on. Another enticing feature of programming is the amount
of creativity involved. Writing a program is similar to writing a paper.
